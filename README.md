**Objective and Significance of the Socket Programming Lab:**
This project aims to demonstrate the practical disparities between the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) within computer networking by implementing client-server socket applications in Python. The lab involves two distinct sets of client-server interactions—TCP using tcp_server.py and tcp_client.py, and UDP involving udp_server.py and udp_client.py. The primary goal is to comprehend, display, and contrast the varying behaviors and characteristics inherent in TCP and UDP protocols.

**Understanding TCP and UDP Differences:**
The Socket Programming lab highlights the distinct features of TCP and UDP protocols. TCP, represented by the provided code, operates on a reliable, in-order delivery mechanism, incorporating congestion control, flow control, and the establishment of a connection before data transfer. Conversely, the UDP implementation showcases an unreliable, unordered delivery system—essentially a 'no-frills' extension of the "best-effort" IP services. Notably, UDP lacks delay guarantees, bandwidth guarantees, and the structural features present in TCP.

**Wireshark: Visualizing Network Traffic:**
Using Wireshark, the lab demonstrates the concrete differences between TCP and UDP in the context of network traffic. Wireshark's packet capture displays the structured, ordered communication of TCP contrasted against the continuous, connectionless data transmission exhibited by UDP. This visualization provides a clear illustration of the diverse behaviors of these network protocols. 

**Python Applications and Practical Networking:**
Furthermore, the provided Python code not only showcases the implementation of TCP and UDP but also illustrates the practical application of Python in networking. These scripts serve as tangible examples, demonstrating how Python operates within client-server interactions, emphasizing the contrasting network behaviors between TCP and UDP protocols.
